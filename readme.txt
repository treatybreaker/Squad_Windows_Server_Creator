This script requires administrative rights to do its job correctly as it opens ports in a firewall.

It will ask a user if they want to use default squad ports (7787, 27165, 21114) or custom ports, then download SteamCMD and create two directores: Server and SteamCMD. After downloading SteamCMD it
will download Squad Server files and pop those into Server and create an update script for it that is reliant on SteamCMD being in the same location after install and a start squad server batch
script along with a readme. The readme is to detail a few configs in the server files such as Server.cfg and Admins.cfg etc.
